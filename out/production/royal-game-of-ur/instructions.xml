<title>Game rules</title>
<p>The goal of the game is to take all seven pawns to the other end of the board. Pawns are placed on the game board in the players pool of ready-to-go pawns. They start their journey over the game board in the field marked "START" on the player's side of the game board (the lane of fields that adjoins the player panel) , they move to the end of the game board, where they turn back and in the middle belt they go in the opposite direction. After reaching the other end of the game board, the pawn returns again moving back in the fields on the edge of the board until they leave the board after passing the field marked as "META". The pawn in the player's fields (the upper and lower lanes of fields) is safe and can’t be captured, but when it is in the fields in the middle lane, it can be captured by an opponent's pawn who had stopped in the same field. The exception is the star field in the middle lane - the pawn in this field can’t be captured either. The captured pawn returns to the pool of ready-to-go pawns. There can always be only one pawn in the field.</p>
<p>After rolling the dice, the player chooses whether he wants to move his pawn on the game board or to enter a new pawn (if he still has pawns in the ready-to-go pool). The player doesn’t have to capture the opponent's pawn. Nevertheless, the player must make a move if it is possible. To complete the passage of the pawn through the board, the player must roll exactly the number one more than the number of fields remaining to pass to the field marked as "META". If a player rolls a larger number and there is no other pawn that he can move, his turn is lost.</p>
<p>The player who first moved all his pieces through the board wins.</p>
